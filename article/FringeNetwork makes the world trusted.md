# FringeNetwork makes the world trusted
Generally speaking, trusted computing adds a trusted module to the user’s software and hardware and checks it during internal operation.

However, for trusted computing, it can guarantee that the data and code are “trusted” It is still built on a centralized independent server, as long as the authority is high enough, or physical destruction, it will cause loss or tampering.

The blockchain has the features of open source code, smart contracts, and distributed clearing and settlement, which can further make up for these deficiencies and push the application of trusted networks to a new level.

Fringe Network will combine SGX and blockchain technology to make trusted computing more robust and further strengthen application support.

Distributed trusted computing technology is adopted, and the reliability of the system is guaranteed through a large-scale global distributed trusted computing cluster.

At the same time, the backup node will be pulled up during the execution of each computing task. Once the master node is broken, the node switch will be initiated to ensure the network.

At the level of future application scenarios, from the personal application side to the enterprise-end user’s trusted data platform, Fringe Network will provide a complete solution for it.

FringeNetwork will build up trusted computing capabilities on-chain and off-chain, and support joint computing and transactions under the premise of protecting data privacy and security. And make it can cover the entire network of secure transmission channels to ensure the safe scheduling and calculation of tasks. Build the next generation of distributed trusted computing platform and give new vitality to blockchain technology and trusted computing technology.


一般来说，可信计算会将可信模块添加到用户的软件和硬件中，并在内部操作过程中对其进行检查。

但是，对于可信计算，可以保证数据和代码是“可信的”。只要权限足够高或物理破坏，它仍将建立在集中式独立服务器上，这将导致丢失或篡改。

区块链具有开源代码，智能合约以及分布式清算和结算的功能，可以进一步弥补这些缺陷并将可信网络的应用推向新的高度。

Fringe Network将结合SGX和区块链技术，使可信计算更加强大，并进一步加强应用程序支持。

采用分布式可信计算技术，通过大规模的全球分布式可信计算集群保证系统的可靠性。

同时，将在执行每个计算任务期间拉起备份节点。一旦主节点断开，将启动节点切换以确保网络。

从个人应用程序端到企业最终用户的受信任数据平台，在未来的应用场景级别，Fringe Network将为其提供完整的解决方案。

FringeNetwork将在链上和链下建立可信的计算功能，并在保护数据隐私和安全的前提下支持联合计算和交易。并使其可以覆盖整个网络的安全传输通道，以确保任务的安全调度和计算。构建下一代分布式可信计算平台，为区块链技术和可信计算技术注入新的活力。
